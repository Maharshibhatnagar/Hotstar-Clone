The command aws eks update-kubeconfig is used to update the kubeconfig file with the necessary configuration information to connect to an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster. Here's a breakdown of the command:

--name <CLUSTER NAME>: Specifies the name of the EKS cluster for which the kubeconfig is being updated. In your example, the cluster name is set to "EKS_CLOUD."
--region <CLUSTER REGION>: Specifies the AWS region where the EKS cluster is located. In your example, the region is set to "ap-south-1."

So, when you run the command:

bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name EKS_CLOUD --region ap-south-1
It fetches the necessary information about the specified EKS cluster (name: "EKS_CLOUD" in the region "ap-south-1") and updates your local kubeconfig file. The kubeconfig file is crucial for interacting with the EKS cluster using tools like kubectl. After running this command, you can use kubectl commands to manage and interact with the EKS cluster seamlessly.
